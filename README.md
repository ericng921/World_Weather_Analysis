# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of the World_Weather_Analysis
### Purpose of the analysis

In the previous module, we had created a map with pop-up Marker using Google API gmaps to find the nearest Hotel for the preferred cities based on the customer's input of minimum and maximum temperature.

In this challenge, we generated more cities based on 2000 size and added the weather description to the weather data, then we used their weather preferences to identify potential travel destinations. We chose four cities to create a travel itinerary and travel route map with marker so the User can easily visualize their travel route and directions on google map.

## Result

In the marker layer map, we can see the details of each city showing Hotel Name and Current Weather Description for any marker on the map

This is the directions layer map showing the directions from start point to the 3 stops and going back to the end point at the end.

## Summary
There are two recommendations to take the app to the next level and a more accurate result.

1. Add another customer input for entering country code to find a more specific place that customer prefer to go travel to.

2. Add an extra code after visualizing the itinerary to save the result such as the Hotel Name and city's detail to a csv file, so customer can save it as record and review it in future.
